	abstract = {Earnings data are often reported in round numbers. In fact, in the March 1995 Current Population Survey (CPS), 71\% of all full-time earnings responses are some multiple of \$1,000. Rounding is typically ignored in analyses of earnings data, which effectively treats it as noise in the data. Our GMM estimates of a simple model of rounding indicate that this behavior is highly systematic and correlated with the respondents’ earnings level. We find that the systematic nature of rounding can affect some commonly used statistics based on earnings data. The statistics we investigate in this analysis are inequality summary measures, earnings quantiles, kernel density estimates, and frequency plots of wage adjustments. We find that rounding alters most of these statistics substantially, that is, by more than the typical level of annual changes or reported standard errors.},

salient. First, using a field experiment in a grocery store, we find that posting
tax-inclusive price tags reduces demand by 8 percent. Second, increases in taxes
included in posted prices reduce alcohol consumption more than increases in
taxes applied at the register. We develop a theoretical framework for applied
welfare analysis that accommodates salience effects and other optimization
failures. The simple formulas we derive imply that the economic incidence of
a tax depends on its statutory incidence, and that even policies that induce no
change in behavior can create efficiency losses. (JEL C93, D12, H25, H71)},

	abstract = {Numerate adults can represent an inﬁnite array of integers. When a judgment requires them to “pick a number,” how do they select one to represent the abstract signal in mind? Drawing from research on the cognitive psychology of number representation, we conjecture that judges who operate primarily in decimal systems simplify by initially selecting from a set of chronically accessible “Prominent Numbers” deﬁned as the powers of ten, their doubles, and their halves [… 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200…]; then, when willing and able, reﬁning from there. A sample of 3 billion stock trades reveals that traders’ decisions reﬂect Prominent-Number clustering (Study 1) and a “natural experiment” reveals more clustering in rushed trading conditions (Study 2). Three sets of subsequent studies provide evidence consistent with an accessibility-based account of Prominent-Number usage: Experiments show that judges rely more on Prominent Numbers when they are induced to rush rather than take their time (Studies 3a and 3b), and when they are under high versus low cognitive load (Studies 4a, 4b, and 4c); and a ﬁnal correlational study shows that Prominent-Number clustering is more apparent for judgments that require judges to scan a wider range of plausible values (Study 5). This work underscores the need to diﬀerentiate between Round Numbers and Prominent Numbers, and between representational properties of graininess and accessibility, in numerical judgment.},

	abstract = {What role do the magnitudes of the constituent digits play in three-digit number comparison (e.g., choosing the larger one of two numbers)? The present study addressed this question by examining compatibility effects between hundred and decade digits and between hundred and unit digits. For example, the number pair 372–845 is hundred–decade incompatible because the larger number contains the smaller decade digit, but hundred–unit compatible because the larger number contains the larger unit digit. We obtained significant effects of hundred–decade and hundred–unit compatibility on number comparison times. However, the effect of hundred–unit compatibility was largely restricted to the hundred–decade-compatible condition. These results suggest that place-value information, through decomposition, is automatically taken into account when multidigit numbers have to be compared. Implications of our findings for models of number processing are discussed.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of applied work using bunching approaches, a development that is closely linked to the increased availability of administrative data. These approaches exploit the incentives for bunching created by discontinuities in the slope of choice sets (kinks) or in the level of choice sets (notches) to study the behavior of individuals and firms. Although the bunching approach was originally developed in the context of taxation, it is beginning to find applications in many other areas, such as social security, social insurance, welfare programs, education, regulation, private sector prices, and reference-dependent preferences. This review provides a guide to bunching estimation, discusses its strengths and weaknesses, surveys a range of applications across fields, and considers reasons for the ubiquity of kinks and notches.},

	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w24991},
	abstract = {We show that administrative hourly wage data exhibits considerable bunching at round numbers that cannot be explained by rounding of survey respondents. We consider two explanations—worker left-digit bias and employer optimization frictions. We experimentally rule out left-bunching by randomizing wages for an identical task on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and fail to find evidence of any discontinuity in the labor supply function as predicted by workers’ left-digit bias despite a considerable degree of monopsony. We replicate the absence of round number discontinuities in firm labor supply in matched worker-firm hourly wage data from Oregon as well as in an online stated preference experiment conducted with Wal-Mart workers. Further, the shape of the missing mass that accounts for the bunching at a round number exhibits none of the asymmetry predicted by worker left-digit bias. Symmetry of the missing mass distribution around the round number suggests that employer optimization frictions are more important. We show that a more monopsonistic market requires less employer mis-optimization to rationalize the bunching in the data. The extent of monopsony power implied by our estimated labor supply elasticities, which are in line with other recent studies, are consistent with a sizable amount of non-optimal bunching, with only modest losses in profits. Overall, the extent and form of round-number bunching suggests that “behavioral firms” can systematically misprice labor without being driven out of the market in the presence of monopsony power.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical explanation for why firms behave as though they use round prices to signal quality. By replacing the linear demand curve in Bagwell and Riordan's (1991) price as a signal of quality model with a kinked demand curve, and analyzing what price endings firms are most likely to use, the following observations can be made: (1) Firms that are using high prices to signal quality are more likely to set those prices at round numbers, and (2) price-endings themselves are not necessarily signals of quality. A simulation was conducted to demonstrate that these findings generally hold true even in the presence of demand spikes at 9-ending prices (e.g., Schindler and Kibarian 1996). Finally, empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that firms tend to use more round prices for higher-quality products, and that this relationship is even stronger for product categories where consumers are less able to detect the true level of quality prior to purchase.},
